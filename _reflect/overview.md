COVID-19 is unlike any crisis we have experienced. It brought our nation to a standstill, and compelled us to stay home, adapt to new norms and overcome countless challenges.

Everyone has a story to tell, and every story shared connects us to someone’s lived experiences, fears and hopes. Through Stories of Us, these are preserved – in your own words and pictures – as a reminder of what living through a global pandemic means to us.

More importantly, these stories reflect how our shared experiences have strengthened our resolve and inspired us to take action. Your reflections and contributions connect us to each other, as individuals and as communities, and enable us to look forward with hope as a nation.
