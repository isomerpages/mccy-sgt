Concerned about the fast-escalating spread of COVID-19 and its asymptomatic infections, Von Leong, along with her 4 co-founders (Melissa Kwee, Dr Evelyn Wong, Dr Yeo Lay Hwee and June Tham), started Masks For All SG to advocate the importance of mask wearing for every Singaporean, a month before it was made mandatory nationwide.

With a simple message for Singaporeans to "Wear it because you care”, the movement – supported by its 6,500 volunteers and 17 partner organisations – has since distributed 500,000 masks to 32,000 beneficiaries.

It hopes to empower more people to incorporate mask wearing into their everyday hygiene practices – even after the pandemic period – as long as one feels unwell.
