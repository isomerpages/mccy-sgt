With the pause on activities and visits prior to the circuit breaker, Faith saw a growing need for newer ways to stay engaged – especially among the elderly and people with disabilities (PWDs). 
 
Working with the support from Our Singapore Fund, Faith (founder of social enterprise ArtSE), launched the SG Strong Box initiative, which seeks to give out art and self-care kits to 350 beneficiaries and 350 caregivers. 
 
Covering wellness and enrichment topics such as eating well, botany, humanities and personal hygiene, each kit comes with a curriculum and clear visual guide. Zoom training sessions are also available for caregivers and volunteers – as well as the beneficiaries to provide more social interactions – along with live crafting sessions.
