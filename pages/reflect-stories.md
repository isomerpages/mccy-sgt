### Story 1
> During home-based learning, I had to teach from my own bedroom... as much as I felt vulnerable, my students must have felt the same way. This is a good experience for empathy-building and growing a shared experience.   
>      
> I hope that no child should feel ashamed of his/her room or house.   
>      
> One thing I hope to do is: opening up conversations about social inequality, social mobility and empowering my students to come on board with me to be champions of change through our community projects.

### Story 2
> I realised that in the midst of the trying times, many of us do try to extend a helping hand, while looking out for each other. It makes me learn the impact one can make, even by a small simple gesture of checking up on others, of standing in solidarity with those in need by donating, all these can make a huge impact on how strong we can stand as a community.   
>      
> One thing I hope to do is: Having tough, difficult conversations with friends and family to discuss how we can help the vulnerable, using that as a platform to encourage others to donate, to volunteer, can eventually send out shockwaves, that incentivize everyone to help each other out and leave a lasting impact.
