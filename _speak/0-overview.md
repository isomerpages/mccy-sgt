### Emerging Stronger Conversations

Join us for a series of conversations to share your hopes for a resilient, post-COVID Singapore society, and how we can work together to create a better future. 

If you know of family members and friends who are keen to sign up for these sessions, please encourage them to sign up.

#### ‘The little moments matter’: S’porean, 26, helps at-risk youths through mentorship & sports  
Inspired by his time working at the Singapore Boys’ Hostel, Joshua Tay wanted to be there for these youths after they left the hostel. Together with his friends, he founded Impart, a non-profit organisation that helps at-risk youth reintegrate into society.
