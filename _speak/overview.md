#### To maintain feelings of happiness, you need to work on it a bit

We may find it hard to have lasting feelings of happiness. This is because our brains are hardwired to prioritise negative experiences over positive ones, for survival. However, like a muscle, we can train our minds be more acute to positive feelings. Read about it here.
